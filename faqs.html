							<li> <b> Are your tutors qualified? </b>
								<p> Yes! All of our tutors are esteemed high school students (or recent high school graduates), almost all of whom have had experience tutoring students before. Here is our <a href="about_us.html">about us page</a> to read about us. If you would like to hear more about us, feel free to reach out to any of us by email or on Discord. </p>
							</li>
							<li > <b>How much do we have to pay for one-on-one tutoring?</b>
								<p> Nothing! One-on-one tutoring sessions are absolutely free, as long as you schedule a session on our <a href = "https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfyg9MbQQitFwouEFxI85VqV5ZcmsPC9RxeDini-1v01FugZA/viewform"> Google Form</a>. </p>
							</li>
							<li> <b> How can we communicate with the tutors?</b>
								<p>Almost all communication will be done through Discord. Tutors will host one-on-one tutoring sessions, post resources and assignments, and answer any questions through Discord, so make sure you join our Discord server!</p>
							</li>
							<li> <b> What is Discord?</b>
								<p> Discord is a messaging and voice calling platform that is designed for easy communication for communities. Our discord will have 24/7 tutors available, text channels for advice or homework problems, and voice calls for private tutoring sessions. Join <a href = "https://discord.gg/2HjjsEA"> here! </a></p>
							</li>
							<li> <b>What kind of resources will you be providing?</b>
								<p>Generally, tutors will assist students with their school assignments and answer any specific questions they might have, but we will also be posting test prep material, study guides, and other useful resources in the Discord server as well. We have currently made an SHSAT program and will be expanding on a SAT one. </p>
							</li>
							<li> <b>Will tutoring continue after the 2020-2021 school year starts? </b>
								<p>Yep, that’s the plan. We will continue online tutoring through Discord, but depending on the status of the COVID-19 pandemic, we hope to even be able to meet in person.</p>
							</li>
							<li> <b>How many tutors are there?</b>
								<p>Upon launch, we have four tutors who started the program. However, we will be expanding our tutoring network very quickly and very soon.</p>
							</li>
							<li> <b>Can I sign up to be a tutor?</b>
								<p>Yes! We are actively recruiting tutors right now, so as long as you’re over 16, you can apply to be a tutor on the <a href = "be_a_tutor.html">tutor signup page </a>which will lead to our <a href = "https://forms.gle/8fQT3koSSxinZXVS8"> Google Form.</a>  One of our tutors will review your application and get back to you as soon as possible.</p>
							</li>
							<li> <b>What if I have a problem with one of my tutors? </b>
								<p>We hope that there won’t be any problems between any of our students and tutors, but if this is the case, please email us at <a href = "mailto: queens247prep@gmail.com "> queens247prep@gmail.com </a> and we will sort the issue out. </p>
