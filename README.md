## Who We Are
Queens 24/7 Prep is run by a group of passionate high school students who have felt the need to create a free, online tutoring service for other students in the Queens community amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Most of our tutors are from Stuyvesant High School, NYC's best high school and rated #1 in America by Niche.com in 2019. Our only goal is to support our community in their academics, especially during these difficult times when standard online classes are insufficient. Through our Discord, we will be able to provide 24/7 access to tutors who will help with any subject and offer personal advice about high school. We also give you the option to sign up for one on one sessions with our tutors. If you ever need any homework help or long term support, mentorship, or general advice, do not hesitate to contact us.
