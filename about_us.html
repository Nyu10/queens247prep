						<h2>Who We Are</h2>
						<p>Most of our tutors are from Stuyvesant High School, NYC's best high school and rated #1 in America by Niche.com in 2019. Queens 24/7 Prep was founded during the Coronavirus pandemic. Our only goal is to support our community in their academics, especially during these difficult times when our online zoom classes are not sufficient for substantial learning. Through our Discord, we will be able to provide 24/7 access to tutors who will help with any subject and offer personal advice about high school. We also give you the option to sign up for one on one sessions with our tutors. If you ever need any homework help or long term support, mentorship, or general advice, do not hesitate to contact us. </p>

							<span class="image right"> <img src="images/nemo.jpg" height="400px" alt="Nehemiah Yu Picture" /></span>
							<h3 style="font-size: 30px;"" ><b>Nehemiah Yu</b></h3>
							<h4> Founder</h4>
							<p> Nehemiah is a rising senior at Stuyvesant High School, where he first started this program to help tutor his friends and his previous camp students. His committment to educating the youth has been exemplified by his extensive involvement in the ARISTA honor society, his local library teaching math, and his job as a teacher's assistant. 
							<br><br>
							At Stuyvesant, he is the captain of both the table tennis and badminton teams, ranking third in the city for high school table tennis! When he's not on the court, he can be found making <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/user/nehemiahyu">Youtube videos</a> and coding such as this website. Here's his <a href = "https://github.com/Nyu10")> Github.</a> 
							<br><br>
							Nehemiah can not wait to help the Queens community ace the SHSAT. Coming from his local zoned middle school, he knew the struggles in finding free resources and studying for the test. His mission to aid the underprivileged community especially in a time of subpar remote learning is the reason he started Queens 24/7 Prep.</p>

							<h3 style="font-size: 30px;"" ><b>Jimmy Zhang</b></h3>
							<h4> Co-Founder</h4>
							<p> Jimmy is a rising senior at Queens High School for the Sciences at York College, where his high scholastic standing and schoolwide engagement have established him among the top of his class. 
							
							<br><br>
							Outside of school, he volunteers at Mount Sinai Hospital as a research volunteer in Dr. Huang's lab, swims for Twisters Swim Club at Laguardia College, and teaches swimming to children at Dolphin Swimming. He is also an active member of his school's Key Club, ARISTA chapter, and math research team.
							<br><br>
							His exceptional performance across a variety of class subjects and standardized tests, his experience volunteering and teaching children, and his incentive to dutifully assist students within the Queens community are all encompassed in his role at Queens 24/7 Prep.</p>

						<div alt="Zen Phyu">
							<span class="image right"> <img src="images/zen1.jpg" padding-left= "5px" height="400px" alt="Zen Phyu Picture" /></span>
							<h3 style="font-size: 30px;"" ><b>Zen Phyu</b></h3>
							<h4> Co-Founder</h4>
							<p> Zen is a rising senior at Stuyvesant High School, where she actively engages in sports teams. She's projected captain of the Stuyvesant's girl's badminton team where she plays singles and has led her team to championships. She is also a member of the girls varsity basketball team for four years and was previously on girl's varsity volleyball. Her commitment to her sports teams has vastly improved her time-management. 
							<br><br>
							Zen has a lot of experience tutoring SHSAT and other subjects to younger students. As a Burmese immigrant, she managed to self-study the SHSAT in a few months and got accepted into Stuyvesant even when the odds were against her! She wants to teach the SHSAT because she has struggled through the test and wants to help underprivileged kids like herself get accepted into a top high school with tips and strategy from her own experience. </p>

						<div alt="Joseph Yu">
							<span class="image right"> <img src="images/joseph1.jpg" height="400px" alt="Joseph Yu Picture" /></span>
							<h3 style="font-size: 30px;"" ><b>Joseph Yu</b></h3>
							<h4> Top Tutor</h4>
							<p> This year, Joseph graduated Stuyvesant High School among the top of his class with a 1590 SAT super score. With multiple top college acceptances, he will be matriculating at the University of Pennsylvania this fall. 
							<br><br>
							In high school, he was a captain of his school's Science Olympiad team, medaling in numerous events. At Stuyvesant's award ceremony, he received distinctions in English, Science Olympiad, piano and history. In his free time, he actively participates in his local church and works as a freelance photographer. 
							<br><br>
							Joseph will be able to offer college advice and mentorship to those who need it. Being the first person in the family to attend an American university, he wants to share his expertise in the college process, the SHSAT, and his high school experience to those who are less fortuante.  </p>
