						<h2>Who We Are</h2>
						<p>Most of our tutors are from Stuyvesant High School, NYC's best high school and rated #1 in America by Niche.com in 2019. Queens 24/7 Prep was founded during the Coronavirus pandemic. Our only goal is to support our community in their academics, especially during these difficult times when our online zoom classes are not sufficient for substantial learning. Through our Discord, we will be able to provide 24/7 access to tutors who will help with any subject and offer personal advice about high school. We also give you the option to sign up for one on one sessions with our tutors. If you ever need any homework help or long term support, mentorship, or general advice, do not hesitate to contact us. </p>
